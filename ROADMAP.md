# Pantry Log - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the Pantry Log application. It is a living document and subject to change based on priorities, resources, and community feedback.

**Current Status:**

*   Repository created on GitHub.
*   Initial `README.md` written.
*   No application code has been written yet.

**Vision:**

To create a user-friendly, cross-platform mobile application that simplifies home pantry management, reduces food waste, and streamlines grocery shopping.

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core Functionality (Estimated: 1-2 Months)

The goal of this phase is to develop a functional application with basic features that demonstrates the core value proposition of Pantry Log.

**Milestone 1.1: Project Setup and Initial Structure (Estimated: 1 Week)**

*   [x] Initialize Ionic Angular project using the Ionic CLI.
*   [x] Set up basic project structure (folders for components, services, pages, etc.).
*   [x] Configure TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier for code quality.
*   [ ] Create initial UI mockups/wireframes using a tool like Ionic Creator, Figma, or similar.
*   [ ] Create placeholder pages/components for main features (Item List, Add Item, Shopping List).
*   [ ] Implement basic navigation between pages.
*   [ ] Set up a basic testing environment (unit and E2E).

**Milestone 1.2: Item Management (Estimated: 2-3 Weeks)**

*   [ ] **Item Model:** Define the data structure for pantry items (name, quantity, category, purchase date, expiration date).
*   [ ] **Data Storage:** Implement local data storage using Ionic Storage (or a similar solution like IndexedDB).
*   [ ] **CRUD Operations:**
    *   [ ] **Create:** Implement the "Add Item" form and functionality to add new items to the pantry.
    *   [ ] **Read:** Display the list of pantry items on the "Item List" page.
    *   [ ] **Update:** Allow editing of existing item details.
    *   [ ] **Delete:** Implement the ability to remove items from the pantry.
*   [ ] **Sorting and Filtering:** Allow sorting of items by name, expiration date, and category. Implement basic filtering.

**Milestone 1.3: Shopping List (Estimated: 1-2 Weeks)**

*   [ ] **Shopping List Model:** Define the data structure for shopping list items.
*   [ ] **Manual Addition:** Allow users to manually add items to the shopping list.
*   [ ] **Basic List Management:**
    *   [ ] View the shopping list.
    *   [ ] Mark items as purchased (and potentially move them to the pantry).
    *   [ ] Remove items from the shopping list.

**Milestone 1.4: Basic Notifications (Estimated: 1 Week)**

*   [ ] Implement a simple notification system (using a library or Capacitor plugin).
*   [ ] Trigger a notification when an item is about to expire (e.g., 1 day before).

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features and Refinements (Estimated: 2-3 Months)

This phase focuses on adding more advanced features, improving the user experience, and preparing for a potential public release.

**Milestone 2.1: Barcode Scanning (Estimated: 2-3 Weeks)**

*   [ ] Integrate a barcode scanning library (e.g., Capacitor's barcode scanner plugin)
*   [ ] Allow users to add items by scanning their barcodes.
*   [ ] Implement a fallback mechanism for manual entry if barcode scanning fails or is unavailable.

**Milestone 2.2: Smart Shopping Lists (Estimated: 2-3 Weeks)**

*   [ ] Implement logic to automatically suggest items for the shopping list based on:
    *   [ ] Low-stock items (configurable threshold).
    *   [ ] Expired or soon-to-expire items.

**Milestone 2.3: Customizable Settings (Estimated: 1-2 Weeks)**

*   [ ] Create a settings page.
*   [ ] Allow users to customize:
    *   [ ] Notification preferences (e.g., enable/disable, timing).
    *   [ ] Low-stock thresholds.
    *   [ ] Default categories.

**Milestone 2.4: UI/UX Improvements (Estimated: 2 Weeks)**

*   [ ] Refine the user interface based on feedback and testing.
*   [ ] Improve the overall user experience.
*   [ ] Polish the visual design (colors, typography, icons).

**Milestone 2.5: Thorough Testing and Bug Fixing**
*   [ ] Conduct comprehensive testing on multiple devices and platforms.
*   [ ] Fix any reported bugs.

## Phase 3: Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

These are features that are not essential for the MVP but could be added in the future to enhance the application.

*   **Cloud Sync:**
    *   [ ] Research and select a suitable backend solution (e.g., Firebase, AWS, Supabase).
    *   [ ] Implement user authentication and data synchronization across multiple devices.
*   **Advanced Notifications:**
    *   [ ] Customizable notification sounds.
    *   [ ] Push notifications (even when the app is closed).
*   **Recipe Integration:**
    *   [ ] Suggest recipes based on available pantry items.
    *   [ ] Allow users to import ingredients from recipes into the shopping list.
*   **Dietary Restrictions and Preferences:**
    *   [ ] Allow users to specify dietary restrictions or preferences.
    *   [ ] Filter items and recipes based on these preferences.
*   **Reporting and Analytics:**
    *   [ ] Provide insights into pantry usage patterns (e.g., most frequently used items, common expiration patterns).
*   **Gamification:**
    *   [ ] Introduce elements of gamification (e.g., points, badges, leaderboards) to encourage engagement and reduce food waste.
*   **Community Features:**
    *   [ ] Allow users to share pantry lists or recipes with family members or friends.

## Timeline

*   **Phase 1 (MVP):**  Months 1-2
*   **Phase 2 (Enhancements):** Months 3-5
*   **Phase 3 (Future Features):**  Month 6 onwards (ongoing)

**Note:** This timeline is an estimate and may be adjusted based on development progress and priorities.

## How to Contribute to the Roadmap

*   Open an issue on the GitHub repository to suggest new features or improvements.
*   Discuss the roadmap in the project's community forum (if one exists).
*   Submit pull requests with roadmap updates (after discussing with maintainers).

This `ROADMAP.md` provides a good starting point for planning the development of the Pantry Log app. Remember to keep it updated as the project evolves.
